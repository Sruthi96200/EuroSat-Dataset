# EuroSat-Dataset
Explored overparameterization in CNNs for satellite image classification using EuroSAT. Developed scalable architectures to evaluate performanceâ€“capacity trade-offs. Benchmarked optimizers and applied L1-norm pruning to assess redundancy, generalization, and implicit regularization in deep learning models.
