Overparameterization in Deep Learning: Satellite Image Classification
This project investigates the impact of overparameterization on the generalization ability of deep neural networks in the domain of satellite image classification, using the EuroSAT dataset. It explores how model complexity, optimizer choice, and pruning affect convergence, test accuracy, and model robustness.

üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview
Objective: Evaluate how increasing model size (SmallNet ‚Üí MediumNet ‚Üí LargeNet) and different optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, Adam) influence generalization, convergence speed, and regularization behavior in CNN-based satellite image classification.

Dataset: EuroSAT ‚Äì 27,000 labeled RGB satellite images (10 classes), size 64√ó64.

üî¨ Key Contributions
Implemented and trained three CNN architectures with increasing parameter complexity.

Benchmarked performance using SGD, RMSprop, and Adam optimizers.

Applied L1-norm pruning to quantify model redundancy and compression potential.

Demonstrated that overparameterized models, despite higher capacity, generalize well and show implicit regularization.

Validated that adaptive optimizers like Adam often outperform SGD in large models under overparameterization.

üß† Techniques Used
Deep CNN architectures with progressive complexity.

Optimization comparison using loss convergence curves and test accuracy metrics.

Filter-level L1-norm pruning for model compression.

Ablation studies to assess robustness and redundancy.

üß™ Experiments
Training & Evaluation: Used 70/15/15 train-validation-test split.

Metrics Tracked:

Cross-entropy training loss

Validation and test accuracy

Generalization gap

Test accuracy after pruning

Results Summary:

LargeNet + Adam achieved the best generalization (Test Acc: ~81%).

Pruning MediumNet and LargeNet retained accuracy, proving parameter redundancy.

Larger models converged faster and exhibited better learning stability.
